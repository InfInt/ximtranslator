		- Modified HoldVarEvent to use AddAnalogValue instead of SetAnalogValue so that it does not override mouse movement, only adds to it.

Nov 24, 2008
		- Added 'joycaps' command which will display joystick capabilities, useful for binding non-xinput joysticks.
		- Added support for joyslider0 and joyslider1 axes, some controllers use these axes.
		
Nov 20, 2008

		- Fixed a bug in Driving Mode that made it hard to play with.
		
		- Added RightStick and LeftStick to the raw output area.

Nov 18, 2008

		- Fixed a bug that caused game specific algorithms to go haywire when an acceleration of 0 was used.
		- Fixed a bug in Vector2 that caused small vectors not to act properly
		- Fixed a bug that caused xEmulate to use max cpu when it was running but did not have window focus, it behaves a bit better in this scenario now :)

		- Added Bioshock 
		- Added Left For Dead
		- Added Rainbow 6 - Vegas
		- Added Orange Box
		- Added "Stick Output" which gives a visual representation of the RS and LS output.
		- Added "Driving Mode", the variable is "drivingmode", when set true the mouse movement is not reset per frame.
		- Added "Detect Joysticks" button, as well as the command "initjoy" which will initialize joysticks if you plug them in after the application is already running.

	- Fixed a bug in TextMode that caused it to not work at all, running at a 15 textmode rate works pretty well now.

Nov 12, 2008

	- Fixed a bug that caused rapid fire to only work for A, and triggers

Nov 11, 2008
	- Fixed a bug that caused Game Specific Algorithm to go haywire at high speeds.
	- Fixed a number overflow in Vector2.Length
	
	- Added ".break" which can be used to skip the remainder of a macro if the button is no longer pressed:
		* bind 360start .start;wait 2000;.break;guide; 
		* This functionality was specifically added to help map the 360 controller.  Because on a PC you cannot check if the guide
		button is pressed, you must 
		
	
	- Tweaked GoW2 game specific.
	- Changed the default buttondowntime to 30 from 50.
	
Nov 10, 2008

	- Added Analog type keybinds: bind g .righttrigger 16000

Nov 8, 2008
	- Fixed a bug where the Y axis was being accelerated way too much at high X speeds.
	
	- Added Joy11 - 30

Nov 6, 2008
	- Fixed a bug that caused smoothness to not update if changed in the UI
	
	- Added a check for XNA dependencies before we run so we dont crash.
	
	- Changed the main loop sleep from 0ms to 1ms, no longer eats CPU cycles( 80% cpu -> 1% cpu cycles )
	
Nov 4, 2008
	- Fixed a bug where if you had a joystick enabled on an analog stick/trigger you could not use autofire for that stick/trigger
	
	- Added Seperating which axis the mouse controls ( Left, Right, None ) for each axis.
	- Added MouseDpi, this will be factored into the Game Specific algorithms to normalize them further.
	
	- Replaced MouseMath with MouseMath2 and removed MouseMath2/GameSettings2

Nov 3, 2008
    - Fixed "echo" to allow more than 1 word to be echoed.
	- Fixed "bind x bind y .a" type binds.
	
	- Added XInput support :)
	- Added a delay to rapid fire "bind mouseleft *righttrigger 40" delays by atleast 40 ms instead of as fast as possible.
	
	- Refactored the BindingManager to only contain 1 dictionary for all IKeys
	
Nov 2, 2008
	- Fixed "exec" to look in the current directory, then the xim configs in my documents, then in app data.
	- Fixed a bug in AnalogEvent preventing flags from working at all.
	- Fixed timing logic in MouseMath and MouseMath2, now correctly scales by the delay. 
	
	- Added unbind <key>
	- Added "link" type bind.  Allows events to be fired when input to the xbox has buttons pressed.
		Example:  "link lefttrigger wait 150;.altsens"
		With this bind, when you zoom in cod4 it will automatically wait 150ms and then engage the alternate sensitivity, this is especially useful when using a toggle zoom bind like "bind mouseright !lefttrigger".  :)
	- Added notification if a joystick was found.
