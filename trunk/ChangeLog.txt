	- Added Analog type keybinds: bind g .righttrigger 16000

Nov 8, 2008
	- Fixed a bug where the Y axis was being accelerated way too much at high X speeds.
	
	- Added Joy11 - 30


Nov 6, 2008
	- Fixed a bug that caused smoothness to not update if changed in the UI
	
	- Added a check for XNA dependencies before we reun so we dont crash.
	
	- Changed the main loop sleep from 0ms to 1ms, no longer eats CPU cycles( 80% cpu -> 1% cpu cycles )
	
Nov 4, 2008
	- Fixed a bug where if you had a joystick enabled on an analog stick/trigger you could not use autofire for that stick/trigger
	
	- Added Seperating which axis the mouse controls ( Left, Right, None ) for each axis.
	- Added MouseDpi, this will be factored into the Game Specific algorithms to normalize them further.
	
	- Replaced MouseMath with MouseMath2 and removed MouseMath2/GameSettings2

Nov 3, 2008
    - Fixed "echo" to allow more than 1 word to be echoed.
	- Fixed "bind x bind y .a" type binds.
	
	- Added XInput support :)
	- Added a delay to rapid fire "bind mouseleft *righttrigger 40" delays by atleast 40 ms instead of as fast as possible.
	
	- Refactored the BindingManager to only contain 1 dictionary for all IKeys
	
Nov 2, 2008
	- Fixed "exec" to look in the current directory, then the xim configs in my documents, then in app data.
	- Fixed a bug in AnalogEvent preventing flags from working at all.
	- Fixed timing logic in MouseMath and MouseMath2, now correctly scales by the delay. 
	
	- Added unbind <key>
	- Added "link" type bind.  Allows events to be fired when input to the xbox has buttons pressed.
		Example:  "link lefttrigger wait 150;.altsens"
		With this bind, when you zoom in cod4 it will automatically wait 150ms and then engage the alternate sensitivity, this is especially useful when using a toggle zoom bind like "bind mouseright !lefttrigger".  :)
	- Added notification if a joystick was found.
