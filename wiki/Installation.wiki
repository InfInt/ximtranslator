= Introduction =

X2 is very simple to install manually and just piggy backs on the current xim360 software installation.

= Details =

Firstly you will need to have the .net framework 3.5 or later installed, available here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=333325FD-AE52-4E35-B531-508D977D32A6&displaylang=en

Download the latest X2.exe here: http://code.google.com/p/ximtranslator/downloads/list

Once downloaded place the file into your xim360 installation folder:

for Vista users this will likely be: C:\Program Files(x86)\xim360\
for non-vista users this will likely be: C:\Program Files\xim360\

Once the X2 file is here your ready to go.  Just double click or create a link for easy access.
