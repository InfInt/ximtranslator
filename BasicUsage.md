# Calibration #

Calibrating is very easy with Xim Translator.  When the application starts it will make sure that it is calibrated.  If it is not calibrated it will attempt to run XIMCalibrate for you.  If you are asked to plug both USB ends of your controller into your computer, this is so the application can calibrate for you.

# Basic Usage #

Xim Translator is designed to work as well as possible with the current Xim360 installation.  After you start the application and it has made sure that you are calibrated it will automatically attempt to find a default configuration to load.  The output window will display information regarding this.  If it succeeds then you are all set to fire away! Click the "Connect" button to connect and begin your gaming!  If you recieve an error message from the output window it should be similar to the errors that XIM creates and the resolutions should be the same.

# Loading a configuration #

We all have our favorite games, Xim translator has a convenient "Load Config" button so that you can load up your configuration and get playing.  When you click "load config" it will launch the standard Open File dialog and you can locate your config!  Xim translator supports reading standard .xim files as well as .cfg files.

Xim Translator configuration files can be loaded from any location, save your configuration anywhere you like, click "Load Config" and locate the file.
